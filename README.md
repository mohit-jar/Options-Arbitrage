## Algorithmic Trading

This project implements a Python-based options arbitrage framework that leverages Blackâ€“Scholes pricing to detect mispricings, applies delta-neutral hedging for risk management, and simulates trade execution on a dataset of 16K+ option and stock records, with full PnL tracking to validate profitability.
